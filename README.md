# SignShare
Version 1 of SignShare (Jun2020)

This is the first website that I ever developed without any help (ie, not in a course). Its intended goal is to connect protesters with people of any kind (particularlly immunocomprimised induviduals given the current state) who are unable to attend protests but still want to demonstrate their voice by making a sign, poster, or other form of media that they want to be used. 

Currently, the first version of this website uses a simple (and rather primative) email service through Flask mail to connect users. In future updates, this will likely be replaced by some other kind of service in order to streamline the process of building more specific components of the site.
